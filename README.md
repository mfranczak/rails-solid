SOLID principles in Rails
==========================
# S - Single Responsibility
tbd.

# O - Open/closed
tbd.

# L - Liskov substitution
tbd.

# I - Injection of Dependencies
Original "I" stands for Interface segregation since Ruby is not a strict typed language I followed the idea from http://www.amazon.com/Engineering-Software-Service-Approach-Computing/dp/0984881247 to replace it with Injection of Dependencies.

# D - Demeter Law
Original "D" stands for Dependency inversion, I covered this principle in "I". The Dependency inversion is replaced with "Demeter Law"
