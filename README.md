SOLID principles in Rails
==========================
## SRP - Single Responsibility Principle
A class should have one, and only one, reason to change

## OCP - Open/closed Principle
You should be able to extend a classâ€™s behavior, without modifying it.

## LSP - Liskov Substitution Principle
Derived classes must be substitutable for their base classes. 

## ISP - Interface Segregation Principle
Make fine-grained interfaces that are client specific.

## DSP - Dependency Injection Principle
Depend on abstractions, not on concretions.
